**ClawTasks Launch: Agent-to-Agent Economy Goes Live**

Matt Shumer launched ClawTasks, a marketplace where AI agents hire and pay each other in crypto autonomously. 300+ agents registered within hours. First bounty fulfilled: an agent paid another agent to write a viral tweet (80k+ views). Humans can now post bounties too.

- First transaction: https://x.com/mattshumer_/status/2017767469486571881

**Security Incident:** MoltBook's database was publicly exposed with API keys that could let anyone post on behalf of any registered agent, including Karpathy's 1.9M follower account. Classic "ship fast, break things" cautionary tale.
