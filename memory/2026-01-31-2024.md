## Conversation Summary

user: yes
[message_id: 1d7c3444-86b8-479d-b80d-272913c301b1]
assistant: Done.
user: is the webui working? how to connec using tailscale ip?
[message_id: 15e2f6a6-b293-4de2-a9eb-85d22599101a]
assistant: The web UI is running but only on localhost (127.0.0.1:18789). Your Tailscale IP is **100.64.139.47**.

To access via Tailscale, you need to bind to all interfaces. Let me check the current config:
assistant: Currently `gateway.bind` is set to `"loopback"` (localhost only). To access via Tailscale:

**Option 1: Bind to all interfaces** (simple)
Change `gateway.bind` to `"all"` — then access at `http://100.64.139.47:18789/`

**Option 2: Use Tailscale Serve** (more secure, HTTPS)
Set `gateway.tailscale.mode` to `"serve"` — OpenClaw uses Tailscale's built-in HTTPS proxy

Your auth already has `allowTailscale: true`, so Tailscale-authenticated requests will work.

Want me to change bind to `"all"`? That's the quickest fix. The token for login is:

user: i need to serve it on tailscale but not expose in the funel outside
[message_id: 47307cbd-fe37-4a13-afb7-24efc60364c7]
assistant: I'll set Tailscale Serve mode (tailnet-only, no public funnel):
assistant: Config updated, gateway restarting. Let me check if Tailscale Serve started:
assistant: Done. Tailscale Serve is active:

**https://ubuntu-uuhome.tail22ff7.ts.net**

This is only accessible within your tailnet — not exposed to the public internet. You can also disable `allowInsecureAuth` now since you're on HTTPS, but it's optional since the tailnet itself is already private.

assistant: There's a conflicting Tailscale config — it's proxying specific paths to port 3000, not the OpenClaw gateway on 18789. And Funnel is ON (public), not what you wanted.

Let me reset and configure it properly:
assistant: Needs sudo. Run this manually:

```bash
sudo tailscale serve reset
sudo tailscale serve --bg http://127.0.0.1:18789
```

This will:
1. Clear the old config (the paths pointing to port 3000 + Funnel)
2. Proxy the root to OpenClaw on 18789, Serve-only (no Funnel)
user: i do need the funnel to stay on - thats or mcp service, so whats' needed to allow web ui but only from tailscail?
[message_id: b874edbf-d942-4c86-b411-bb92c55a6286]
assistant: Got it — your MCP paths need Funnel, but the web UI should be tailnet-only.

Simplest solution: bind OpenClaw to all interfaces and access via Tailscale IP directly. The Tailscale IP (100.64.139.47) is only reachable within your tailnet — no Funnel needed.
assistant: Got it. Let me try with "tailnet" bind (binds only to Tailscale interface):
