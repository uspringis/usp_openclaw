OPENAI & DEPARTMENT OF WAR

- Altman hosted AMA on DoW agreement. Key reflections: surprising debate about government vs private power, what if government tries to nationalize AI, people take national security for granted

- OpenAI published contract language — claims more guardrails than previous classified deployments including Anthropic's. They retain full discretion over safety stack, deploy via cloud, cleared personnel in loop. Notably: they don't think Anthropic should be designated a supply chain risk

- Willison published new Agentic Engineering Patterns chapter on using coding agents to fight "cognitive debt"
  https://x.com/simonw/status/2027885000432259567
- Addy Osmani on the "factory model": orchestrate agent fleets like a production line with TDD. Unsolved problem is verification, not generation
  https://x.com/addyosmani/status/2027662887897149801
- filpizlo built "t800" — coding agent in containers, no permission prompts

What's status of Lizete schedule job?
assistant: Last two runs (Feb 27 and Feb 28) both timed out at the 180s limit. The last successful run was Feb 26 (took 120s -- already close to the limit).

The job is doing a lot of work: fetching multiple spreadsheet tabs, parsing CSV, comparing calendar events, creating/deleting events. 180s isn't enough when it needs to process a new week.

Quick fix -- increase the timeout:
assistant: Timeout increased from 180s to 300s. Last successful run took 120s, so 300s should give enough headroom even when it needs to create/delete events for a new week. Next run tonight at 20:00.

```

Investigate deeper, the job is quite quite simple, and run it.
assistant: The `cron run` CLI itself timed out at 30s (its own default timeout), but the job is still running in the gateway. Let me check the runs after it finishes.
assistant: Ran successfully this time -- 153s, created 8 events for Mar 2-6. The previous timeouts at 180s make sense now: it's legitimately close to the limit when creating events. With the new 300s timeout it completed fine.

The job isn't simple -- it's doing 30K tokens worth of work: fetching multiple spreadsheet tabs, parsing CSV, checking existing calendar events, creating 8 individual events via gog CLI. 153s is reasonable for that with Opus.

So the fix was correct -- just needed more timeout headroom. The two failed runs (Feb 27-28) were likely weeks where it needed to create new events rather than just confirm existing ones.

Schedule for this week is now synced:
- Mon: muzikala nodarbiba, repertuars, klasika
- Wed: repertuars/akrobatika, laikmetiga deja, ADIEMUS atlase
- Fri: hiphop (sk.Maija), klasika (sk.Vera)

Can we optimize the fetching part so the first just the fetch which Tabs are there and then use the tabs to find out which one needs to be downloaded not download everything is there such an option
assistant: 

Good idea. The current approach downloads CSV for every tab to check headers. Google Sheets HTML view already contains tab names in the page, so we can extract tab names + gids in one request, then only fetch the CSV for the matching week.
assistant: The JS references are generic. Let me look for actual tab content/IDs differently:
assistant: There it is. The tab names and gids are all in the `items.push` calls at the bottom of the HTML. Now I can optimize the prompt to extract tab names from one HTML fetch instead of downloading every CSV.
assistant: Done. The key optimization: instead of fetching CSV for every tab to check headers (11 requests), it now extracts all tab names + gids from one `htmlview` fetch, picks the right one, then downloads only that single CSV. Should cut the runtime significantly.
