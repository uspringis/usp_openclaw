## MikroTik ATL 5G R16 Monitoring

Ugis wants to buy a MikroTik ATL 5G R16. Set up 2x daily stock checks (10:00, 15:00 Riga time) on:
- https://www.getic.com/product/mikrotik-atl-5g-r16
- https://nasstore.eu/product/mikrotik-atl-5g-r16-atlgmrg520f-eu/
- https://router.lv/product/757/lv/

Also monitoring Gmail for reply from smartech.ee (Ugis emailed info@smartech.ee -- their site shows available but he wants confirmation since nobody else has it).

Cron job IDs:
- 10:00 check: `07202afa-c84f-4778-bf30-ed003e1aaadd`
- 15:00 check: `72085852-050e-4ecd-a88b-290e80082b38`

Notify via Telegram only when something is found.
